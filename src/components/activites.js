                    The amenities of New Amsterdam include the first established synagogue in the continental United States. New Amsterdam also offers a Jewish cemetery. It is entirely Jewish and Christian-free. Jews are not required to pay extra taxes (America is great). There is plenty of opportunity for serving in the local militia, which not only gets you the respect of a military man. And if you want to, you can even go beaver hunting! The financial trade is open to Jews, which is one of the many great things to do in this wondrous city.  </p>

                <p className='mx-8 text-lg'>However, New Amsterdam still has some terms and costs. The governor, Peter Stuyvesant, is not a fan of the Jews and has to be pressured by the Dutch West Indies company to even allow you to land. While extra taxes on the Jews were decreased, the initial taxes for the Jews were still pretty high. The governor has promoted antisemitic images and promoted the idea of Jewish usury. The restrictions also include not being allowed to be serving in the military. Jews have been restricted from the mercantile trade. However, these restrictions have been lifted thanks to the Dutch West Indies company and its Jewish shareholders.  </p>
