                Established in 1625, New Amsterdam was a predominantly Christian city located in the northeastern region of what we now call the United States. Being along the Hudson River, NA's primary source of economic stability came from beavers. Citizens would use beavers as a means of food as well as a means to make other products such as pearls and perfume. In 1655, the population jumped by about 2100 due to an influx of European immigrants. Later in 1664, NA would become occupied by the English, who renamed it New York.

                The original place of origin for the Jews was Portugal, but unfortunately, they were expelled to the Netherlands and, from there, traveled to Dutch Brazil. Due to a conflict between Portugal and the Dutch, the 23 Jews were expelled from Dutch Brazil. In 1654, the 23 Sephardic Jews arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. At first, the Jews were met with hostility from the governor, but due to pressure from the Dutch West Indies company, they were allowed in. The Jews were allowed to be merchants, serve in the militia, and even establish the first synagogue and cemetery in the United States.
